QSL
===

QSL is a free (LGPL), Qt-based C++ library that provides classes for
data visualization and numerical computations. At this time only the
visualization classes are being written but in the near future we
plan to integrate routines inspired on those in GSL <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl>
in a cool C++/Qt fashion.

Although QSL is in it's first steps, here is a demonstration of what
it can already do:
